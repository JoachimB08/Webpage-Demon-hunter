        <p>Our careless feet leaving trails,
        <br>
        Never minding the fragile dirt we all land in.</p>
        <p>Dead flowers for the torn apart,            <br>
           Laid at the grave to heal a broken heart.</p>
           <p>Like blood in the tears of all my enemies,
            <br>
            Knowing the pain the way they should.</p>

                <h1>Join The Resistance</h1>
                <p>The Blessed Resistance is a fan community unlike any other. From the very inception of Demon Hunter, our fans have proven their devotion time and again. I know this sounds cliché, and you’ve probably heard other bands speak similarly about their fans. The difference is that we can prove it. From hundreds of tattoos, loads of fan art, and lyrics etched into gravestones, it has become clear to us that the culture surrounding this band is anything but typical.
                    <br><br>
                    We started the Blessed Resistance in 2007 as an outlet to bring us even closer to our fans. What we hope to offer you now is more than just insight into the band and a handful of goodies, but an in-depth and very personal portal into our lives, interests, influences, and more—with an extremely heavy dose of what makes Demon Hunter tick. Our goal is to raise the bar for fan communities at large, and we believe we’re in a position to do just that. 
                    <br><br>
                    TBR is part lifestyle blog, part Demon Hunter-centric editorial, part educational outlet, and part clothing label, just to scratch the surface. We’ve done our best to conceive of unique content that we believe will resonate with the fans, but we also want to create content that adapts to you. We will frequently ask about the kinds of things you’d like to see, and do our best to curate a more personalized experience for all of you.</p>

        <p>All of the sorrow, all of the pain hold me down,
            <br>
            This is the battle within my name forever.</p>
        <p>And if tomorrow never comes,
            <br>
            For all the cold and bitter ones,
            <br>
            Let us sleep.</p>
